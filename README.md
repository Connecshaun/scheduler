# Interview Scheduler :technologist:

Interview Scheduler is an application that allows students to create, edit and delete interview appointments.

To book a new appointment start by clicking on the "plus" button in an empty time-slot.

After filling in our name and selecting the interviewer, we could always "cancel" if we change our mind or "save" the details if we are all-in.

Upon "saving" the appointment details, the appointment is added to the daily schedule.

If you would like to edit an existing appointment, hover over the appointment and select the edit button.

If you click the edit button, you have the option to edit the entire appointment.

Now we are underway, editing all of the appointment details including our preferred name if we wanted too.

Just click on the save button afterwards and your changes will be stored.

Now, if for whatever reason we were planning to be busy eating :pizza: on the day of our appointment, we have the option to delete it by hovering over our scheduled appointment and clicking on the trash button.

If we had greasy fingers from our :pizza: and accidentally clicked on the trash button to delete our appointment, we have a second check to confirm that we actually didn't just have greasy fingers.
